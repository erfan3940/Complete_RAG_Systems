# 🚀 Complete_RAG_Systems

A comprehensive, modular, and practical implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems built with **LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith**, customized for **Persian language** while remaining usable in **any language**.

This repository gathers almost everything needed to **learn, experiment with, and build production-ready RAG systems**, combining course learnings with custom implementations and practical experiments.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Complete_RAG_Systems** is designed for:

- ML & NLP developers
- Students learning modern RAG pipelines
- Engineers building production AI assistants
- Developers needing reusable RAG components

This repository serves as:

✅ A structured **learning resource**  
✅ A modular **production-ready foundation**  
✅ A reference for modern RAG implementations

With small customizations, components here can power real-world AI applications.
