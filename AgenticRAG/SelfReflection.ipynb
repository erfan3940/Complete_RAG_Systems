    "# Self-Reflection\n",
    "A technique where an LLM is prompted to review, critique, or verify its own initial response, often leading to a revised, improved answer. This is a form of meta-reasoning where the model acts as its own \"critic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate an initial answer.\n",
    "- Reflect on potential errors, omissions, or reasoning flaws.\n",
    "- Refine the answer based on self-feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improving accuracy in complex QA, code generation, or planning tasks.\n",
    "- Detecting and reducing hallucinations, logical inconsistencies, or alignment issues.\n",
    "- Often used with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to re-check reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low-cost way to boost performance without extra training or retrieval.\n",
    "- Can catch simple mistakes the first pass missed.\n",
    "- Enhances explainability by revealing the model's internal critique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited by the model's own knowledge and self-awareness — cannot correct fundamental knowledge gaps.\n",
    "- Can lead to \"overthinking\" or excessive refinement without real improvement.\n",
    "- May introduce new errors during the reflection stage if the critique is flawed."
